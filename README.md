### Writeup
1. - The challenges I faced was dealing with useState hook and its interaction with the data strucutres such as object or array. Often I stored the data within an array and used useState to update the data, the data just somehow not updated properly. Or the React rendered too fast before the data successfully updated. Getting the overall grid's data and properly updated it with useState is the hardest part.
2. - I do want to get more in depth or spend more time to think about how to properly structure my app. Overall, I think the Grid function can be well improved, or could be furthur break down into smaller component. And I think I would consider using more useContext or props to better instructured my app.
3. - My assumption is that everytime the user interact with the app, the grid or the cells should be updated. However, I'm thinking if there is any other possibilities or any other way to structured my app. So the grid updating can be a lot smoother and faster.
4. - Spend about four to five days. Getting the grid to properly updated, implementing the heat map, and getting each boxes' keys attributes correctly are the most time-consuming parts.
